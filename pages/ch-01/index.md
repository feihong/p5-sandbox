### Exercise 0.2

What is the probability of drawing two aces in a row from a deck of 52 cards, if you reshuffle your first draw back into the deck before making your second draw? What would that probability be if you didnâ€™t reshuffle after your first draw?

The probability of drawing two aces with replacement is $\frac{4}{52} \cdot \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{169} \approx 0.59\%$. Without replacement: $\frac{4}{52} \cdot \frac{3}{52} = \frac{3}{676} \approx 0.44\%$.

### Exercise 0.3

Create a random walker with dynamic probabilities. For example, can you give it a 50 percent chance of moving in the direction of the mouse? Remember, you can use `mouseX` and `mouseY` to get the current mouse position in p5.js!
