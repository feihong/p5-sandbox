<b>Exercise 0.1</b>
Create a random walker that has a greater tendency to move down and to the right.

<p>
<b>Exercise 0.2</b>
What is the probability of drawing two aces in a row from a deck of 52 cards, if you reshuffle your first draw back into the deck before making your second draw? What would that probability be if you didnâ€™t reshuffle after your first draw?

  <b>Exercise 0.3</b>
  Create a random walker with dynamic probabilities. For example, can you give it a 50 percent chance of moving in the direction of the mouse? Remember, you can use mouseX and mouseY to get the current mouse position in p5.js!
